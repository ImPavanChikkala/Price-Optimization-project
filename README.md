# Price-Optimization-project


ðŸ“Š Price Optimization Project â€“ Data Analysis with Python
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes retail sales data to identify optimal pricing strategies for different items across stores. Using historical transaction data, the analysis evaluates how price changes impact sales quantity, revenue, and competition positioning. The goal is to recommend price points that maximize both sales and profitability.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used

--Python (Data Analysis & Visualization)

--Pandas â€“ Data cleaning & manipulation

--NumPy â€“ Numerical computations

--Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Visualization of trends & relationships

--Scikit-learn â€“ Modeling and predictive analysis

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information

The dataset contains weekly transactional data from retail stores with the following key columns:

--Fiscal_Week_ID â†’ Week identifier (time period of sales)

--Store_ID â†’ Store identifier

--Item_ID â†’ Product identifier

--Price â†’ Itemâ€™s selling price during the week

--Item_Quantity â†’ Number of units sold

--Sales_Amount_No_Discount â†’ Total sales without discounts applied

--Sales_Amount â†’ Actual sales revenue after discounts

--Competition_Price â†’ Competitorâ€™s price for the same product

ðŸ”‘ Key Analysis & Insights

--Price Elasticity of Demand â†’ Measured how changes in price affect item sales quantity.

--Revenue Optimization â†’ Identified price levels that maximize sales revenue.

--Profitability vs Competition â†’ Compared store prices with competitor pricing to find competitive yet profitable price points.

--Store & Item-Level Trends â†’ Analyzed sales performance across different stores and products.

ðŸ“ˆ Results

Found that moderate price adjustments increased sales by X% while maintaining profitability.

Identified products where pricing below competitor level drove higher demand.

Discovered that high discounts reduced margins without significantly boosting sales for some categories.
